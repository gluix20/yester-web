      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>
        We offer you a journaling platform to record your memories and, if you
        wish, share them. You’ll need to download our Application and become a
        Registered User (see Section 2) to start your own journal, and then you
        start “writing.” Based on your subscription level, certain features and
        functions will be made available to you, including the ability to
        “publish” your entries. Read on and we will tell you how this works.
        Please remember that the following Terms of Use can feel like a legal
        document because, well, it is a legal document. If you’re going to
        invest lots of time in using our Services we recommend you read it,
        maybe even twice, because we want you to gain comfort and confidence in
        the agreement.
      </p>
      <h4>Use of the Services and Company Properties</h4>
      <p>
        The Application, the Software, the Website, the Services, and the
        information and content available on the Website and in the Application
        and the Services (as these terms are defined below) (collectively, the
        “Company Properties”) are protected by copyright laws throughout the
        world. Subject to the Terms, the Company grants you a limited license to
        reproduce portions of the Company Properties for the sole purpose of
        using the Services for your personal or internal business purposes.
        Unless otherwise specified by the Company in a separate license, your
        right to use any Company Properties is subject to the Terms.
      </p>
      <h4>Application License</h4>
      <p>
        Subject to your compliance with the Terms, the Company grants you a
        limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable
        license to download, install and use a copy of the Application on a
        single mobile device or computer that you own or control and to run such
        copy of the Application solely for your own personal or internal
        business purposes. Furthermore, with respect to any Application accessed
        through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an “App Store Sourced
        Application”), you will only use the App Store Sourced Application (i)
        on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary
        operating system) and (ii) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth
        in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <h4>Company Software</h4>
      <p>
        Use of any software and associated documentation, other than the
        Application, that is made available via the Website or the Services
        (“Software”) is governed by the terms of the license agreement that
        accompanies or is included with the Software, or by the license
        agreement expressly stated on the Website page(s) accompanying the
        Software. These license terms may be posted with the Software downloads
        or at the Website page where the Software can be accessed. You shall not
        use, download or install any Software that is accompanied by or includes
        a license agreement unless you agree to the terms of such license
        agreement. At no time will the Company provide you with any tangible
        copy of our Software. The Company shall deliver access to the Software
        via electronic transfer or download and shall not use or deliver any
        tangible media in connection with the (a) delivery, installation,
        updating or problem resolution of any Software (including any new
        releases); or (b) delivery, correction or updating of documentation. For
        the purposes of this section tangible media shall include, but not be
        limited to, any tape disk, compact disk, card, flash drive, or any other
        comparable physical medium. Unless the accompanying license agreement
        expressly allows otherwise, any copying or redistribution of the
        Software is prohibited, including any copying or redistribution of the
        Software to any other server or location, or redistribution or use on a
        service bureau basis. If there is any conflict between the Terms and the
        license agreement, the license agreement shall take precedence in
        relation to that Software (except as provided in the following
        sentence). If the Software is a pre-release version, then,
        notwithstanding anything to the contrary included within an accompanying
        license agreement, you are not permitted to use or otherwise rely on the
        Software for any commercial or production purposes. If no license
        agreement accompanies use of the Software, use of the Software will be
        governed by the Terms. Subject to your compliance with the Terms, the
        Company grants you a non-assignable, non-transferable,
        non-sublicensable, revocable non-exclusive license to use the Software
        for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the Services in the manner
        permitted by the Terms. Some Software may be offered under an open
        source license that we will make available to you. There may be
        provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of
        these terms.
      </p>

        that you have installed on your computer or mobile device. You
        acknowledge and agree that the Company may update the Company Properties
        with or without notifying you. You may need to update third-party

        agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the
        transmission of Your Content, including without limitation chat, text,
        or voice communications. In the event that the Company pre-screens,
        refuses or removes any Content, you acknowledge that the Company will do
        so for the Company’s benefit, not yours. Without limiting the foregoing,
        the Company shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the

        or liability for the deletion or accuracy of any Content, including Your
        Content; the failure to store, transmit or receive transmission of
        Content; or the security, privacy, storage, or transmission of other
        communications originating with or involving use of the Company
        Properties. Certain Services may enable you to specify the level at
        which such Services restrict access to Your Content. You are solely
        responsible for applying the appropriate level of access to Your

        Company and its suppliers own all rights, title and interest in the
        Company Properties. You will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright,
        trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated

      </p>
      <h4>Trademarks</h4>

        Company’s stylized name and other related graphics, logos, service marks
        and trade names used on or in connection with the Company Properties or
        in connection with the Services are the trademarks of the Company and
        may not be used without permission in connection with any third-party
        products or services. Other trademarks, service marks and trade names

        title in or to any Content that appears on or in the Company Properties.
      </p>
      <h4>Your Content</h4>
      <p>
        The Company does not claim ownership of Your Content. However, when you
        as a User post or publish Your Content on or in the Company Properties,
        you represent that you own and/or have the rights to grant the license
        below in Section 5.5 for Your Content.

        the Company a fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable,
        worldwide, non-exclusive and fully sublicensable right (including any
        moral rights) and license to use, license, distribute, reproduce,
        modify, adapt, publicly perform, and publicly display, Your Content (in
        whole or in part) and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form,
        media or technology now known or later developed, for the purposes of
        operating and providing the Company Properties to you and to our other
        Users. Before that scares you off, keep reading. We know these rights
        seem broad, but we are trying to cover all of the use cases for Your
        Content in one sentence – otherwise, this Agreement would be even
        longer. Don’t worry – this does not mean that all Content you provide us
        will be made publicly available. We will use Your Content in accordance
        with the settings in which you submitted such Content, as detailed under
        our Privacy Policy . To be clear, if Your Content is a journal entry or
        page, the default is private to you. Please remember that other Users
        may search for, see, use, and reproduce any of Your Content that you
        “publish” on the Company Properties. You warrant that the holder of any
        worldwide intellectual property right, including moral rights, in Your
        Content, has completely and effectively waived all such rights and
        validly and irrevocably granted to you the right to grant the license
        stated above. You agree that you, not the Company, are responsible for
        all of Your Content that you Make Available on or in the Company
        Properties.

      <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
      <h4>Third-Party Websites & Ads</h4>
      <p>
        The Company Properties may contain links to third-party websites
        (“Third-Party Websites”) and advertisements for third parties

        (including privacy policies) of another website or destination. Such
        Third-Party Websites are not under the control of the Company. The

      </p>
      <h4>App Stores</h4>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application and
        the Services is dependent on the third party from which you received the
        Application license, e.g., the Apple iPhone or Android app stores (“App
        Store”). You acknowledge that the Terms are between you and the Company
        and not with the App Store. The Company, not the App Store, is solely
        responsible for the Company Properties, including the Application, the
        content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty therefor,
        and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability,
        legal compliance or intellectual property infringement). In order to use
        the Application, you must have access to a wireless network, and you
        agree to pay all fees associated with such access. You also agree to pay
        all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the
        Company Properties, including the Application. You agree to comply with,
        and your license to use the Application is conditioned upon your
        compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement (e.g.,
        the App Store’s terms and policies) when using the Company Properties,
        including the Application. You acknowledge that the App Store (and its
        subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of the Terms and will have
        the right to enforce them.
      </p>
      <h3>Fees and Purchase Terms</h3>
      <h4>General Purpose of Terms: Sale of Service, not Software</h4>
      <p>
        The purpose of the Terms is for you to secure access to the Services.
        All fees set forth within and paid by you under the Terms shall be
        considered solely in furtherance of this purpose. In no way are these
        fees paid considered payment for the sale, license, or use of the
        Company’s Software, and, furthermore, any use of the Company’s Software
        by you in furtherance of the Terms will be considered merely in support
        of the purpose of the Terms.
      </p>
      <h4>Payment</h4>
      <p>
        You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with
        the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or
        charge is due and payable. Currently, all payments are made through the
        Application. If the Company offers alternative methods of payment, you
        may be required to provide the Company with a valid credit card (Visa,
        MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) or PayPal account
        (“Payment Provider”). Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use
        of the designated credit card or PayPal account, and you must refer to
        that agreement and not the Terms to determine your rights and
        liabilities. By providing the Company with your credit card number or
        PayPal account and associated payment information, you agree that the
        Company is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees
        and charges due and payable to the Company hereunder and that no
        additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately
        notify the Company of any change in your billing address or the credit
        card or PayPal account used for payment hereunder. The Company reserves
        the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either
        immediately upon posting on the Company Properties or by e-mail delivery
        to you.
      </p>
      <h4>Service Subscription Fees</h4>
      <p>
        You will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for any
        Services (each, a “Service Subscription Fee”) at the time you upgrade to
        a premium subscription (each, a “Service Commencement Date”). Except as
        set forth in the Terms, all fees for the Services are non-refundable. No
        contract will exist between you and the Company for the Services until
        the Company accepts your order by a confirmatory e-mail or other
        appropriate means of communication.
      </p>
      <h4>Taxes</h4>
      <p>
        The Company’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If any Services,
        or payments for any Services, under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax
        in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax
        to the Company, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales
        Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority,
        and you will indemnify the Company for any liability or expense we may
        incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon our request, you will
        provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing
        authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable
        taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or
        use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that the Company
        is permitted to pass to its customers, that is the functional equivalent
        of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not
        otherwise impose a sales or use tax.
      </p>
      <h4>Withholding Taxes</h4>
      <p>
        You agree to make all payments of fees to the Company free and clear of,
        and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed
        on payments of fees to the Company will be your sole responsibility, and
        you will provide the Company with official receipts issued by the
        appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as we may
        reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.
      </p>
      <h4>Automatic Renewal</h4>
      <p>
        Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in
        accordance with the Terms. After your initial subscription period, and
        again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will
        automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period
        (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional
        equivalent period, at the Company’s then-current price for such
        subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this
        automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at any
        time prior to the Renewal Commencement Date by logging into the account
        settings of the App Store used for your purchase. If you do not wish
        your Account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or
        terminate your subscription, please log in and go to the account
        settings of the App Store used for your purchase. If you cancel your
        subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your
        then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed
        after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible
        for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for
        the then-current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize the
        Company to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at the beginning
        of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your
        subscription, if the Company does not receive payment from your Payment
        Provider, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon
        demand, and/or (ii) you agree that the Company may either terminate or
        suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment
        Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your
        Account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your
        new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was
        received).
      </p>
      <h4>Free Trials</h4>
      <p>
        Any free trial or other promotion that provides Registered User level
        access to the Services must be used within the specified time of the
        trial. At the end of the trial period, your use of that Service will
        expire and any further use of the Service is prohibited unless you pay
        the applicable subscription fee. If you are inadvertently charged for a
        subscription, please contact the Company to have the charges reversed.
      </p>
      <h4>Other Promotions</h4>
      <p>
        We may run promotional offers from time to time on the Website. The

        otherwise indicated, we may establish and modify, in our sole
        discretion, the terms of such offer and end such offer at any point.
      </p>
      <h4>Disputes</h4>
      <p>
        You must notify us in writing within seven (7) days after receiving your
        credit card statement, if you dispute any of our charges on that
        statement or such dispute will be deemed waived. Billing disputes should
        be notified to the following address: Luis Galvez, Attention: Chief
        Executive Officer, 11 avenida 11-49 zona 17, Guatemala City, Guatemala.

      <h4>Indemnification</h4>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its parents, subsidiaries,
        affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners and licensors
        (collectively, the “Company Parties”) harmless from any losses, costs,
        liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating
        to or arising out of: (a) Your Content; (b) your use of, or inability to
        use, the Company Properties; (c) your violation of the Terms; (d) your
        violation of any rights of another party, including any Users; or (e)
        your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. The Company
        reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and
        control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in
        which event you will fully cooperate with the Company in asserting any
        available defenses. You agree that the provisions in this section will
        survive any termination of your Account, the Terms or your access to the
        Company Properties.

      </p>

        If you do not have a subscription for the Company Properties, we may
        suspend, modify or terminate any of the Services or Company Properties
        at any time. The Service Subscription Fee for any Service shall be
        non-refundable. If timely payment cannot be charged to your Payment
        Provider for any reason, if you have materially breached any provision
        of the Terms, or if the Company is required to do so by law (e.g., where
        the provision of the Website, the Application, the Software or the
        Services is, or becomes, unlawful), the Company has the right to suspend
        or terminate any Services provided to you. You agree that all
        terminations for cause shall be made in the Company’s sole discretion
        and that the Company shall not be liable to you or any third party for

        also includes deletion of your password and all related information,

      </p>
      <h4>Assignment</h4>
      <p>
        The Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be
        assigned, subcontracted, delegated or otherwise transferred by you

        foregoing will be null and void.
      </p>
      <h4>Force Majeure</h4>

        OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
      </p>
      <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        Any claim or dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable
        relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms where the total
        amount of the award sought is less than Five Thousand U.S. Dollars (US
        $5,000.00) may be resolved in a cost effective manner through binding
        non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking
        relief. Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established
        alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers
        arbitration as set forth in this section and under the rules of such ADR
        Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the
        Terms. The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and
        the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR
        Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the
        following rules: (1) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone,
        online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific
        manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (2) all
        arbitration proceedings shall be held in English; (3) the arbitration
        shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
        unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties; and (4) any judgment
        on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
        competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including
        attorney fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and
        shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may seek injunctive or other
        equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights in any
        court of competent jurisdiction. Please note that the laws of the
        jurisdiction where you are located may be different from Utah law,
        including the laws governing what can legally be sold, bought, exported,
        offered or imported. You shall always comply with all the international
        and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations and statutes that are
        applicable to your use of the Company Properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any other dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable)
        shall be referred to and finally determined by binding and confidential
        arbitration. Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act
        and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted
        before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in
        resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration
        Association (“AAA”). As modified by the Terms, and unless otherwise
        agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed
        by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems
        them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
        Disputes (collectively “Rules and Procedures”).
      </p>
      <p>
        You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend
        your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court.
        Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge
        or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration
        procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.
        Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are
        subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
      </p>
      <p>
        You and the Company must abide by the following rules: (i) ANY CLAIMS
        BROUGHT BY YOU OR THE COMPANY MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL
        CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
        OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (ii) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE
        MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM
        OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE
        RELIEF; (iii) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the
        costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of
        litigation, the Company will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees
        in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to
        prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the
        cost of litigation; (iv) the Company also reserves the right in its sole
        and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs
        of the arbitration; (v) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege
        and privacy recognized at law; (vi) the arbitration shall be
        confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content
        or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for
        the purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (vii) the
        arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that
        are permitted by applicable law; and (viii) each side pays its own
        attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that
        requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation
        expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be
        determined by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        The arbitral proceedings, and all pleadings and written evidence will be
        in the English language. Any written evidence originally in a language
        other than English will be submitted in English translation accompanied
        by the original or true copy thereof. The English language version will
        control. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
        decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the
        award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The
        arbitrator will not have authority to award damages in excess of the
        amount, or other than the types, allowed by Section 12 of the Terms.
        Judgment on the award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of
        competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant
        any temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief it
        deems just and equitable and within the scope of the Terms, including,
        without limitation, an injunction or order for specific performance. The
        arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties without
        appeal or review except as permitted by California law or United States
        federal law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an
        individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation,
        violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or
        misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or
        trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such
        claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts
        located in Salt Lake County, Utah. Additionally, notwithstanding this
        agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief
        before the state or federal courts located in Salt Lake County, Utah, in
        order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree
        to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located
        within Salt Lake County, Utah for such purpose. A request for interim
        measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the exception of (d)(i) and (ii) above (prohibiting arbitration on
        a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision
        is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise
        conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this
        arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in
        accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or
        conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, either
        (d)(i) or (ii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then
        the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and
        neither you nor the Company shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any
        reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the
        dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court in Salt
        Lake County, Utah. By using the Company Properties in any manner, you
        agree to the above arbitration provision.
      </p>

        The Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and
        interpreted by and under the laws of the State of Utah, consistent with

        Goods does not apply to these Terms.

        unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain

        modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent
        permitted by law.
